# fast-conformal
This program computes a spherical conformal mapping for the given mesh input. The program utilizes the fast optimization technique using spherical constraints given in the paper "Folding-Free Global Conformal Mapping for Genus-0 Surfaces by Harmonic Energy Minimization" by Lai et. al (2014) and also incorporates Barzilaiâ€“Borwein step size computation for further speed.

## Setup and Usage

Run the following commands in your bash terminal

1. cd ./Code/Conformal/
2. make
3. Conformal <input_file_path> <output_file_path>

Both input and output files should be .obj or .m file formats.
